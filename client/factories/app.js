At each crumb the user is presented with various media left by the creator of the trail, or \'crumblayer\'. Crumb media can be anything from text, images, or even augmented reality! This allows the crumblayer to craft unique trails, using videos, sounds, or virtual drawing to provide the client with an interactive experience. This benefits multiple business avenues like the tourism industry, local musicians, theatre troupes, or even a user who wants to provide a romantic memory for their significant other.',
